### a note on this repo
The old code is in $PROJECT_ROOT/MM4. I didn't want to delete it or start a new repo, because I wanted to show the progress which was made. Also, I don't know what pieces of MM4 are salavageable for MM5.

# MegaMonopoly
Welcone to Mega Monopoly! An attempt to increase the complexity of monopoly to better simulate the real world of finance and economics.

You should think of this fundamentally as a roleplaying game. The gamemaster is the bank, the server, the stock market, the judge during a trial, or whatever else the game demands he be. Whatever he says is law. 

The turn-to-turn action of rolling dice, collecting 200$ for passing GO, buying properties and paying rent is all in-tact. Mega Monopoly introduces new income streams, and new ways to fuck with your rival companies.

Players each represent a mid-tier asset management company, competing against other management companies to dominate the country's economic system. Players are strongly encouraged to invent new and novel ways to mess with their opponents, and allow the gamemaster to resolve them on the fly.

LET'S MAKE SOME FUCKING MONEY!!!
